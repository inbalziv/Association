<h2>Since its establishment in 1927, The Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in Israel (SPCA Israel) has been working for the prevention of cruelty and suffering in animals and the promotion of their rights and welfare</h2>
<p>
  The Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in Israel, founded in 1927, is the most established organization in Israel dealing in animal welfare and animal rights, and its principle aim is the prevention of cruelty and suffering in animals. The association is a non-profit organization (NPO) which is directed by a committee of volunteers, and its accounts are supervised by a CPA and the registry of associations.

  The Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in Israel offers a variety of services, including: sheltering abandoned animals and finding them adoptive homes, a veterinary clinic, boarding kennels for pets, and spacious stables where horses and donkeys that have suffered abuse and neglect are rehabilitated. SPCA is proud of its Humane Education Department that runs educational activities for groups of all ages and all sectors. The Society is also active at the Parliamentary level, lobbying for laws that promote animal welfare.

  According to SPCA policy, its doors are open at all times to all animals in need of shelter and protection. In addition, as a result of many years’ experience, the SPCA has created “Responsible Adoption”, the aim of which is to reach optimal compatibility between animal and adopter, so that the animal will be raised in its new home for its entire life span. All the dogs and cats that are given out for adoption are neutered or spayed. These principles, which were determined to reduce uncontrolled propagation, thus minimizing the number of stray animals, stem from our commitment to prevent animal suffering.

  In the first SPCA shelter, established with the assistance of the British authorities on Salame Street, Tel Aviv, we mostly cared for horses, donkeys and camels. These “beasts of burden” were abandoned when they grew ill or old. In the first decades of the SPCA’s existence, dogs and cats were considered by the public to be physical and health threats. As a result of changes in the economic and social climate in the country, the practice of raising pets became accepted and popular, though the Society still has to deal daily with the phenomena of abandonment, neglect, abuse and distress which animals of all kinds continue to suffer to this day.
